# Drone-Delivery-Problem-datasets-and-related-parameters


There are THREE datasets which are given by three csv files


(1) Drone 1 to 4 with their parameters and (2) Drone 1 to 10 with their parameters

*Units: g = gram, km = kilometre, min = minutes, m/s = meter per second*

Drone = drone ID or NUMBER

Payload = limitation weight in gram to carry per drone

Speed = the speed that the corresponded drone is allowed to fly

Coverage Distance = the distance measured from the center/depot/warehouse place and the corresponded drone is allowed to fly within that distance 

Flight Time = the corresponded drone's flight time in minutes related to the speed and their respective battery capacity



(3) Location 1 to 100 with their parameters
